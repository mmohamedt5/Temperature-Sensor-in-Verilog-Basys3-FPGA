# Temperature Sensor using a Basys3 FPGA written in Verilog # 

## DSP.V ## 
This file includes a running average for the temperature readings coming in from the sensor

## Top File ##
This file is like the main file that brings all the different source files together such as the DSP

## Basys3.xdc ##
This is the constraints file for the Basys3 FPGA Board that maps the input and outputs to the verilog source files
